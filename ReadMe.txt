ArkanoidSFML

This is a simple "Breaking blocks" game created using SFML .NET. 
There are a lot of things that could be done better, but it was a fast project and I've commited it as is.

To compile and run you need two things
1. SFML .NET installed:
NuGet command:
Install-Package SFML.Net -Version 2.5.0

or download and add reference into Visual Stiudio manualy:
https://www.nuget.org/packages/SFML.Net/

2. Coppy .dll files 
From AndroidSFML/lib folder to ArkanoidSFML/bin/Debug folder
